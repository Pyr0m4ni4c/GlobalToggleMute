# GlobalToggleMute

Run the executable, link it with your keyboard/mouse software and assign it to a hotkey to quickly mute/unmute your audio input. 
If you chose to use the installer you need to search for the executable ToggleMuteDiscord.exe in "C:\Users\TAlei\AppData\Local\Apps\...".

If running this executable doesn't result in Windows muting all relevant audio inputs try calling the executable passing an arbitrary amount of parameters i.e. "ToggleMuteDiscord.exe test".
